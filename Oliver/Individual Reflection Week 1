what do I want to learn or understand better?
More of Scrum so we can better organise.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We are still not experts on scrum since we haven't had our big lecture on it yet,
so a better understanding of scrum can help those who have a hard time with it.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Read about it and discussed it together with my team so that we were all on the same page.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Helped organise GitHub and set up the social contract. Finding information about the reflection.
