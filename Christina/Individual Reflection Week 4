What do I want to learn or understand better?
Week 4 was less intense on this course due to deadlines in another course. So the next week I
want to try new and bigger parts. I think working out a scheduler that arranges study and exercise
would be a great such task for wich I even can reflect back on classes from last year.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have helped out with getting github and AndroidStudio work together for my team mates and
helped them to understand how and when to use fetch, commit or merge.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I stick to the planning we make in the beginning of each sprint, as the scrum master I also
started booking group rooms for our onsite meetings so we don't lose time searching for a
suitable place to sit.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I implemented a simple saving function for the set preferences. I also implemented that a
numerical correspondence to the value in the seekbars is shown.
