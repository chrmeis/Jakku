What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since we're about to finish work on the functionality of the app and progress to polishing it
I expect to get new insights to our code that I have not been realizing before and maybe being
able to make it more efficient or readable.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As this week more of us worked with visualizing features I realized how much I have learned about
textview, constraints and so on. I was abel to help my team mates with that. The new week we
mostly will polish our code and improve our comments, so I I can help them with that as well.


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I contributed towards our meetings and kept towards this weeks user stories. As the scrum master
I also made sure we had locations to meet and did my best to distribute the workload evenly
to all of us.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
this week I unfortunately have not contributed that much. Something went wrong with a push
on monday that resulted in some part of the new code was pushed, other parts got reset. So A lot
of this week went through programming mondays part and later reprogramming it. But I also increased
the code quality by making it more readable for humans.
