Estimated time spent:
1h commenting my code
3h preparing our presentation and solving merge conflicts

What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since this is the last week, im quite happy right now with what I have learned this week.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since we merged everything together, no questions were brought up from the team members this week.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
I attended all the meetings this week. Other than that, we didn't use a lot of Scrum this week due to the project soon being over and due to exams.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week, I helped with merging the code together, aswell as commenting some code that I had done.
