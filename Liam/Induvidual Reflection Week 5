Estimated time spent: 7h of meetings (planning, supervision and retrospective etc) and 1h of coding (improving the notifications function)

What do I want to learn or understand better?

It's been hard figuring out what the next thing to learn would be. Everything regarding Android Studio would be nice of course, but for the moment I'm not sure what
a specific thing would be. We are going to have a new meeting early next week to decide what our next improvement on the app will be. It will probably be something new
that I have to learn anyways, so what I'm doing next week will be the thing I'm gonna focus on understanding better.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I'm still trying to show my team my implementation of the current task I have. This week, I explained how I improved the notifications function. My goal with this is to
give them an idea of how it works and the tools you can use in Android Studio. This way, they might use it in upcoming tasks.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I joined all the meetings for this week as usual. I also noted at the beginning of the week that we had to do our retrospective in the end of the week. I attended the
retrospective and contributed with my own thoughts. So far, this week has been the most successful when it comes to the use of Scrum. It's been hard noticing before, but
now I think this week is gonna be my goal of using scrum from now on.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I chose the assignment of improving the Notifications function so that the user won't get a notification of drinking a glass of water in the middle of the night.
Right now, the user won't get a notification during 00.00 to 06.00. My task for week 5 is done, with other words. I got done with the task which is kind of what you
would always want from a sprint.
