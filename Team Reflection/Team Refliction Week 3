Each week:
• your social contract,
which means you should create one in the first week
• the success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to
achieve with your application
• the three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress
• the roles you have used within the team
• relation to literature and guest lectures
(how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)
• the chosen scope of the application under development,
including priority of features and for whom you are creating value
• your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with
whom
• the design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns
etc.)
• the behavioural overview of your application
(for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)
• the structural overview of your application
(such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)
• your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance
criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation
• the agile practices you have used for the current sprint
• the time you have spent on the course
(so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)
• the sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or
meeting the product owner)
• best practices for using new tools and technologies
(IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)
