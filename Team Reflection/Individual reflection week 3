16/9 - 2022

Estimated time: 8-9 hours

A: This week we started creating user stories, estimate time per story, done more planning,
the first supervision and also learning android studio. The progress is going fine.
I am learning a lot, both too implement the scrum method but also some techincal things like how to
work with android studios. I feel that i have contributed well in the scrum-process by
reading the instructions and discussed many scrum features with my group members. In the scrum phase,
I carefully went through the INVEST criteria on every user story to make sure we implemented them correctly.
The scrum master planned and structurized the project so that the scrum method became a natural way of approaching the project.

B: Next sprint I want to learn android studio even better. Since we're all in the same course we have
quite similare knowlegde in programming. I have som experience with web design and layouts, perhaps this
could be usefull in the implementation of the application. It will also be intresting if we manage to estimate
how much we can achieve next week.

C: The plan is to continue to watch tutorials on youtube for android studio since this seams to be the
best way to learn. To make sure we will be able to deliver something valuable i think one key will be to
continue to make small fractions of user stories. In this way we will be able to adapt if things are hard.
