What do I want to learn or understand better?
This week I looked up tutorials for how to schedule notifications. I managed to make that work for 1 scheduled notification.
I found that youtube tutorials are often best for understanding what the code is doing.
I want to look into how to schedule multiple notifications, but I am not yet sure which user stories we want to focus on next week.
If it's a good user story for next week I want to learn more about scheduling multiple notifications and will do so primarily using youtube.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I shared with the team that I have found videos to be a better resource than text for learning.
If my team members have issues I will try to help solve them. I will do this by giving examples if I've encountered something similar, or 
try to help find something on google if the problem is new to me too.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
As the current project owner I talked with the stakeholder, telling him what the plan for this week is and recieving feedback on how it's good for the 
user to be able to set a fixed location for weather data and relaying that to the team.
I was also a part of the process of making user stories/tasks and evaluating them.
I want to make sure we have user stories that we can finish in a week, so I will try to ask more about why team members make certain estimations, 
to see if the rest of the team agree or if they see differnt issues.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I finished the user story regarding daily notifications. I found this was a good amount of work for the week, and no team members asked for additional help 
with their tasks. I also helped with the team reflection.
I want to continue picking good sized chunks of work for the week and finish them, and I will do so by trying to estimate well how hard a task can be.
