What do I want to learn or understand better?

Since scrum is a new concept I want to learn how to make good user stories.
In order to do this I will look a bit at examples on the internet, but mostly think back on previous 
projects and how those could've been structured with scrum.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Scrum is new for all of us, so in order to make the team more comfortable with using scrum I will 
discuss with the team if something seems unclear

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?

Since the project hasn't been decided yet scrum hasn't been fully used. After deciding a project, I will help by 
coming up with good sized user stories with the gorup.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

This weeks delivery is the social contract. I contributed by attending our meeting and discussing what it should entail.
We also started looking for possible projects and I helped by finding API's that could be useful.
This is what I expected to do for this week, in order to keep on track I should think more about what projects 
we can do.
