... what you want the situation to be or "what might or should be" (B), and
... a plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be or "feedback designed to reduce the gap" (A -> B).


What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to get comfortable with andriod studio since that is the environment we intend to use for tRAINing.
So far I know only that it is based on intelliJ which is an advantage since I have worked with that before.
Therefore I want to to start playing around with the IDE.
Regarding last week I feel I got a better understanding of the scrum process.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Whenever I find some information that seems relevant to tRAINing I will share it with them regardless
if it is relevant for the branch I work on or someone else. As a group we also participated in this weeks
exercise which improved our all understanding of scrum and how we work together as a team.


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I will start up a trello board so we can start collect our epics, user stories and tasks.
Moreover I worked together with my team mates on the exercise and on the deliverables.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I as well as my teammates have prepared the presentation for the project pitch, unfortunately i was
unwell on wednesday so therefore i missed out on presenting tRAINing. But on thursday it payed of that I
rested the day before and I was able to take part when we crated our business model canvas.
