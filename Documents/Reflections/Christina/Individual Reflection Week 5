... the current situation or "what is" (A),
... what you want the situation to be or "what might or should be" (B), and
... a plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be or "feedback designed to reduce the gap" (A -> B).


What do I want to learn or understand better?
As I have already started with the scheduler, I would like to continue with that and figure out
how to integrate the existing scheduler into the practising part.


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week I helped out Erik in how to use draw.io for creating a class diagram without
creating all forms from scratch. Since I made a bigger class diagram in an other course I don't
want to take this task on me in this course so my teammates can have that learning experience
as well, but I hope I can support them based on my prior experience.


What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
As a part of the team I stuck to the set tasks for this sprint and
as a scrum master I took care of the room booking as well as out KPIs


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
this week I was making the basic scheduler and I want to continue with that for the next week.
