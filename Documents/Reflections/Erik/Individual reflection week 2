4.5 hours

A: We have learned more about scrum through the slicing the cake exercise.
We have also decided and presented our project idea.

B: Next phase is to start making user stories to make our project move forward.
We need user stories that we can deliver on one sprint but also identify epics eg. We also want a good scrum structure.

C: We might use a online tool to make a backlogg, like toggle. We will also work together create these
user stories.




Step A "What is"
Step B "What might or should be"
