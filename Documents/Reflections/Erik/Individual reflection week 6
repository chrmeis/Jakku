7/10 Estimated time 10 hours so far - Erik Gustavsson

A: This sprint I worked on schemacreator together with Christina. I tried to implement
a system where main has a instance of an date object which could be sent into schema creator to make
it visualize choosen schema. I implemented buttons and made the date object work but for some reason the
schema object didn't return the schema i wanted. Christina made a different solution that worked
so i scraped my branch. I also spent a couple of hours error to make android studio work since the
emulator struggled to start. I realized in the end that my laptop with 8 GB of ram wasn't sufficient to
run the emultor since we switched to a Pixel 3. When running om my desktop ram usage was around 13-14 gb.
Lesson learned: you need alot of ram to emulate a phone in android studio. Even do my solution didn't end up
in the project we developed the schema we wanted and I've learnt more about app development this week.

B: Next week we want to join together notifications, weather, schema and training to have a minimal viable
product of what we thought of from the beginning.

C: To get there, I will work on my desktop since my laptop isn't strong enough. We will also distribute
and estimate user stories since this is working well.
