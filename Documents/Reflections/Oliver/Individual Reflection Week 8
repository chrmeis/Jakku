What do I want to learn or understand better?
I feel like I have a good understanding about everything in our project and since this is also the last sprint there's not much else to learn for the next sprint.
Better understanding about refining existing and working code would be nice but I don't feel like it's necessary.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
If anyone gets stuck then I could spend some time helping them.
This week the biggest issue we had was merging the branches and the branches I spent the most time on didn't really cause much trouble so it was better for others to help with that while I did something else.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I participated in our meetings and refined some of our code. We didn't really have user stories for that part tho.
We didn't really utilise scrum much this week.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I went through how we were going to present our work together with our team and then participated in our meetings where we tried to make some last adjustments for the project.
We had some merge conflicts that I tried to help with.
