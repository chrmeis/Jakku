What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about android studio and how to develop a mobile app.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help them by explaining how the code I've written works and also explain any new things I learn about the developing mobile application since we're all new to that.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We all divided the work so that we could separately work on different parts without having to wait for others to complete their work.
I have done my part like everyone else and taken part in our meetings and where we check up how the others are doing.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I've done my part swell as talked to other members to see how they are doing with their deliveries and this week we finished almost everything, just a tiny little thing we didn't do.
