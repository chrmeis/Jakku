What do I want to learn or understand better?
I feel like I've got a pretty good grasp on the situation right now.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
There were some space issues with the Android Emulator that I taught the others about in case they got the same problem as me.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I help by participating in everything we plan and divide up the work among us.
We write our user stories and reflections at the end of the week.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Turns out the weather class didn't work correctly so I tried to fix it but there are still issues.
This week I added support for using notifications in the weather class, however they haven't been implemented yet.
