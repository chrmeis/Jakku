What do I want to learn or understand better?
I feel like I'm in a good spot right now with my knowledge.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We are satisfied with how much we've done and don't want to start some massive new thing to do.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We are continuing with our meetings and writing user stories to divide up the work.
I'm helping with all of that to ease the project.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I've written comments for the code and drew some pictures as well as implemented them into the code.
