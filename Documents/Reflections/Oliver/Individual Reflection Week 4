What do I want to learn or understand better?
Currently there is not anything big that I know that I want to learn.
Better understanding is always good but not necessary right now.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I've helped with getting github working for others in the team.
Soon we are going to merge and work together more in the projects so we are probably going to need to do it more.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I participate in our meetings as well as help following our user stories approach whilst working.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I've worked on the weather API which finally worked correctly and was able to show the current temperature on the home page.
