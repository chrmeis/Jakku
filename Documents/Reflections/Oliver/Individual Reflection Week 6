What do I want to learn or understand better?
Right now I feel like I've got an understanding of everything I want.
A better understanding of what the others have written is always nice but I feel like I understand it pretty well.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I've worked together with multiple people this week so I helped them by explaining the functions they asked for.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We are continuing with our meetings and writing user stories to divide up the work.
I'm helping with all of that to ease the project.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I finally understood why the weather class didn't work all the time and it was because of an issue with the emulator.
Now it works constistently and can be implemented with the other parts of the program.
I helped by developing various functions to help others in the team.
