What do I want to learn or understand better?
Due to time issues and a reprioritisation of tasks I did not look further into notifications this week. Instead I learned more about github, branches and gitignore.
This is not quite as much as I would like to learn for a week.
For next week I want to look further into class diagrams and how to model those in a useful way.
I will do this by finding examples of how projects can be split into classes in a good way.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We all had some varying degrees of struggles with github this week, so I helped making switching branches smoother by making a .gitignore.
Since a big group activity next week is class diagrams I will share what I know about them so we can together make a good diagram.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
As PO I tried to dial back some ideas and discuss a minimal viable product, so we can all agree what we need to work on.

--
What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week only the team reflection sadly. This was due to time being spent on meeting a set deadline in another course.
Next sprint will be easier to split the time for the week, and in order to help with the deliveries I will choose tasks during the Monday meeting that I 
know I can finish before the week is over.
