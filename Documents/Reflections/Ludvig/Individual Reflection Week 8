What do I want to learn or understand better?
Due to upcoming exams I did not get that in depth with how our code works, but I had time to look at parts at least.

--
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
There weren't that many questions and not that much to learn this final week.

For future projects I can help the team learn new things by asking questions myself when I don't understand something, which hopefully makes 
everyone else more comfortable to ask questions. 
By knowing what everyone is working on it makes it easier for me to share my knowledge, so I should keep track of that too.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
This week didn't utilize a lot of Scrum, since it was mostly just putting everything together.

For future projects I would try to have an agenda for the meetings so the meetings stay focused. Other than that I would mostly 
do what I have done during this project.

--
What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I participated in the meetings, the supervision and the presentation.
I also wrote some javadoc comments for the classes I've worked on.

Overall I am pleased with my contribution towards the team's deliveries throughout the project.
