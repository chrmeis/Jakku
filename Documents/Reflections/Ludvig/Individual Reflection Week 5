What do I want to learn or understand better?
Other teammembers handled the class diagrams with some add-ons, I was looking at making notifications work again at the time.

One issue with my chosen user story this week was something trying to run on the main thread that can't run there.
For the next sprint I want to understand threads a bit better. I will mainly do this by finding examples on how they're used in different code.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
My experience with notifications helped another teammember with their notification issues this week.

If a teammember asks for help I will try my best to help them. In order to do this everyone needs to ask when they need help, so I will 
ask questions when I get stuck to try to encourage others to ask too.

What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
As PO I need to make sure that the user stories being chosen are the highest priority ones. This week the team already chose user stories that I found 
relevant, so I didn't have to do much. I want to make sure the team keeps picking relevant user stories, and I will do this by getting feedback from 
the stakeholder.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
Notifications are mostly working with weather data, some issues need to be fixed regarding the alarmreceiver running on its own thread.
I did not manage to finish what I set out to do this week, due to issues with files not being added properly during merge.
I want to finish what I set out to do during a sprint, and believe I would have if not for this unforseen issue.
Hopefully next week has no unforseen issues, and I can properly estimate how much I can finish.
