Estimated time spent:
1h meeting on monday
1h lecture about final report
4h Sprint review and team reflection
2,5h Coding on travel recommendation

What do I want to learn or understand better?
This will be my final week on working on the code for the project. Next week, we will make javadoc comments on all our code including classes, methods and variables.
We also have an exam this week in another course, so we all will take a small break on the project before we begin with the final reflection report. Therefore, I feel
like I have learned what I have wanted to learn and I also feel like this project was the perfect fit for us. We all had knowledge about programming in Java before this
project but developing an app for Android was something new for all of us. I feel like everyone involved has learned something new from the project.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
After having lots of good communication with my team members, I will be happy to help with any documentation of the code if someone in the team doesnt understand it.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have attended the meetings with my team members this week. I also attended the last lecture that covered information about the final report, which I will use to do my
best on writing the report with my team members.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My contribution this week has been the same as the last week but now it is finally implemented. I ended up using the approach I thought of the most, using a string
that updates itself whenever it's raining, whenever it's sunny or when it's cold outside. The string then tells the user weather it's recommended to take the bike, 
take a walk or go biking. I'm really happy how it turned out.
