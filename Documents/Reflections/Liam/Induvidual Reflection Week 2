what do I want to learn or understand better?

This week, we presented our app idea and have made a decision to make the app exclusive to Android using Android Studio. We chose that particular program/IDE since
we since exclusively have been programming in Java the past year, and that's what the IDE offers. Even though it is regular Java, there seems to be some slight
differences on how you write the code and also some tools you can use that we have never done before. I would really want to learn more about how we could use some of
these tools. Luckily, there are a lot of information about it on the Internet. So to reduce the gap, my plan is to watch some videos about the subject.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

If we find different things that could help us build the application, it might be a good idea for us to look for information about different stuff about developing
the app. For example: one person looks for GUI design, one looks for code implementation and one looks for tools for building the app.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Together with my team, I attended this weeks exercise where we worked on coming up with user stories with the cake slicing method. This will for sure help us next week
when we have scheduled to come up with some of our own user stories.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

My contribution this week has been to construct the Canvas Business model together with my team, and also contributing with my own opinions and thoughts regarding
what to add into the diffrent sections in the model itself. So far, I have nothing to complain about. Even though we started a bit late with the Canvas Business Model, we
still had really good pace on the work we did and had some good communication in the team.
