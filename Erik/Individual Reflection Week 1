We started from scratch. As a team we we're jet to decide project, scrummaster and social contract.
The cooperation went well. The team have all worked together in earlier projects.
After 2 hours we have written down a social contract we all can agree on. We have also decided scrum master
and a pilot on what our project will be. I feel like i have a ok understanding on the current sitiuation.

We want to have a clear project goal with a couple of DoDs.
To get to where we want. We also want to have a clear work distribution, this is however only something
we can do when we have our project approved.

and also reherse the agility work method. With scrum and so on.
