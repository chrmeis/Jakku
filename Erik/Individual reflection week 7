14/10 Estimated time 12 hours - Erik Gustavsson

A: This week I have been working on exercises. Since the programming platform now feel
familiar and that I now have some experience with the android studio gui this task went very smoothly.
The goal this week was to finish the most important last user stories. After that I've looked into
other parts of the code to see if i can help somewhere and also doing som code review. Also
I've started commenting. I also got time to test it on my own phone which worked, but with some layout flaws.

B: I'm happy with the outcome and since this is the last developing sprint there's not much I want to
change. The last tasks is to merge together every part into a functioning

C: Meet on monday and merge together everything.
