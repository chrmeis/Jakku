tRAINing - Jakkus project

We're creating a mobile application to ease your active life and goals based on the weather and other preferences.
The application will take into account how the weather is and what the users practice preferences are and accommodate to that.
The app will make a schedule based on these factors.
This will work towards goal 3.4 to Reduce mortality from non-communicable diseases and promote mental health.
The app will be an android based app. The base idea with exercises is to suggest different basic types such as
walking, running, bicycling eg. So not detailed exercises to start with. We might make this more advanced in later stages.
