30/9 Estimated time 10 hours so far - Erik Gustavsson

A: This sprint we have been working on further user stories. I've learned github even better know which
have helped to be able to advance the project. Still alot of time was spent trying to understand how branching/merging
works which to a lot of time. I also had to redo some parts i did last week since i accidently deleted in
by writing over local files when checking out. And when doing this a ran into a new problem which made me stuck.
However in the end i solved the problems and managed to push my work, the waterintake page.

B: Although some issues occured I think our scrum method is quite efficient.
Ideally no more time needs to be spent on struggling with android studio next week.

C: To make the work efficient with android studio next week. Always update to latest version, always download
gradle files before running. Always push a branch before checkout.
